        <h4>What was the problem?</h4>
        <p>
          For the kata 5-Built-in methods, when doing the deBee.js question, I
          was able to build a function that removed the buzz word from the
          string regardless of capitalization by using the
          <code class="techcodeline"> replaceAll()</code> string method, however
          while the function console logged correctly, it did not pass the last
          test.
        </p>
        <h4>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h4>
        <p>
          I first tried looking at the function in the test file and tried
          googling the methods used to understand what the function was trying
          to solve and how it worked, however I didn't understand how my
          function was still failing the test.
          <br />
          After about 30 min of trying to reverse engineer the test function to
          understand it, I decided to reach out to the help channel to get some
          idea of the problem.
          <br />
          Gerard was able to help me with understanding the big picture of the
          test and that the intention of the exercise was to solve it with
          arrays. This pointed me in the right direction.
          <br />
          I then had another student notice my question on the help channel and
          offered a hint to help me out. I was appreciative but wanted to figure
          it out on my own, but took the chance to rubber duck with them over
          discord, helping me put into words what I needed to achieve in plain
          english, as steps.
          <br />
          I then researched how to solve the issue using arrays, and was able to
          correct my function to solve the last test
        </p>
        <h4>How did you feel throughout the process?</h4>
        <p>
          I often feel nervous asking for help, but since learning about the
          benefits of maintaining a growth mindset, I've been more open to
          challenge that uncomfortable feeling I have about asking for help and
          get over it. Now that I've done it, I don't feel uncomfortable about
          it anymore.
        </p>
        <h4>What did you learn?</h4>
        <p>
          The main lesson I learnt is that there are multiple ways to approach a
          solution, but determining the right one depends on how well you
          understand the question.

        <h4>What was the problem?</h4>
        <p>
          I was trying to find a way to create a drop down paragraph that was
          revealed when clicking on the title header. When formulating my
          initial function, I ran into an issue where clicking the header for
          one para opened all the other hidden paragraphs too.
        </p>
        <h4>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h4>
        <p>
          I wasn't able to solve the issue in my js file before the sprint 3
          deadline, so I pseudocoded it to address later. I then came back
          during sprint 4 and did alot of googling to find different techniques
          people use to achieve an accordian style hidden paragraphs, then went
          back and unpseudocoded my function and refined it, before testing it
          out in the DOM to confirm it worked.
        </p>
        <h4>How did you feel throughout the process?</h4>
        <p>
          I felt pretty satisfied with my work, especially now that it is a
          re-useable peice of script I can use for the rest of my blogs
        </p>
        <h4>What did you learn?</h4>
        <p>I learn't the importantance of making code more re-useable.</p>

        <h4>Pseudocode</h4>
        <p>
          I'm pretty confident using pseudocode. It can be quite useful for
          stepping out what you want a function to do, and also just labelling
          what each functon in your js file achives.
        </p>
        <h4>Trying something & Console logging</h4>
        <p>
          Testing and using dev console to check that functions return the
          correct value is pretty useful. I think it's one of the best methods
          of checking your work and I'm getting more confident doing so.
        </p>
        <h4>Rubber ducky method</h4>
        <p>
          Rubber ducking is something I now realise I do pretty often but ever
          had a name for it. Im pretty confident in being able to have an
          internal monologue to work through my problems
        </p>
        <h4>Reading error messages & Googling</h4>
        <p>
          It's pretty easy to copy errors into google and get a link to an
          article (usuallyc a stack overflow article) explainging the error so
          Im fairly confident with this.
        </p>
        <h4>Asking your peers & coaches for help</h4>
        <p>
          I've often been uncomfortable doing this, but if I want to build a
          growth mindset, I need to challenge this discomfort and make more of
          an effort to do it more.
        </p>
        <h4>Improving your process with reflection</h4>
        <p>I'm slowly getting used to this one.</p>

          I think for me, what has made me reluctant before was re-enforcement
          by others that I'd look incompetent for asking questions. I'm slowly
          learning that that's not the case, and I'm getting over the discomfort
          of asking questions
