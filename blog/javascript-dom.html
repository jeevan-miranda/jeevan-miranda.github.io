    <h3>What is Javascript?</h3>
    <p>Javascript is a coding language that makes web pages interactable. It can give buttons and writeable text boxes functionality by    causing changes in the webpage when users interact with those webpage elements.<br>
    It also allows for other dynamic features like videos, slideshows and animated graphics	to be implemented in a webpage.
    </p>
    <h3>How does it relate to HTML and CSS</h3>
    <p>
      HTML, CSS and Javascript work togeether to make the foundation of web development.
      <ul>
      <li>HTML contains all of the headers, text any any images you want to display in the webpage.</li>
      <li>CSS controls how the page looks, such as modifying fonts, background colors and where each HTML element sits on the webpage.</li>
      <li>Javascript makes the webpage come alive by letting users engage with the different elements of your webpage.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      An analogy that best describes the relationship would be that of kitchen:<br>
      HTML is the language that would determine what applicances and furniture would be in the kitchen<br>
      CSS would then work to arrange the design of the kitchen, detemining where applicances like the fridge and toaster should be placed, and also deciding what colour the kitchen tiles should be. Overall it works to make the kitchen look pretty.<br>
      Javascript would then be the language that makes all the appliances in the kitchen work, e.g making sure that the toaster is plugged in so that when a user presses down on the toaster handle, it starts the heating element.

    <h3>Control flows and loops</h3>
    <h3>Control Flow</h3>
    <p>Control flow allows our code to make decisions on what code is executed and when. It allows developers to specify what parts of thecode are run and under what conditions.<br>
    The easiest way to understand how a control flow works is by looking at a flowchart. When following a flowchart, each decision can lead to a different outcome as it determines what decision or outcome comes next. Similarly, control flow allows developers to set conditions that need to be met for the code to execute to achieve the appopriate outcome.
    </p>
    <h3>Conditional statements:</h3>
    <p>Conditional statements are basically checks to see if a certain condition is either true or false. If a condition is true the run code A, it it's false run code B. For example in the flowchart Fig.1 the question Is it alive? has two possible answers and then if the condition is true (yes) it runs code A (which triggers the next condition 'Should it be moving'), or false (no) it runs code B (providing outcome "Don't hit it").
