        <p>
          Emotional Intelligence (EI) is the ability to manage both your own
          emotions and understand the emotions of people around you. There are
          five key elements to EI: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation,
          empathy, and social skills. <br />
          People with strong emotional intelligence are able to understand their
          own emotions and the emotions of others and use that information to
          inform their own behaviour when approaching situations.

        <p>
          EQ is a measure of your emotional intelligence, assessing your ability
          to manage and express your emotions. It helps you identify your own
          feelings and the feelings of other and adjust your behaviour to
          approach situations in a calm and professional manner. <br />
          IQ is a measure of your capacity to learn, comprehend and apply
          knowledge in specific situations. It involves applying logic and
          verbal communication to solve complex issues. <br />
          Having a good EQ means you can emphatize with others and control your
          reactions, allowing you to manage relationships with clients and
          co-workers. A good IQ allows you to apply your knowledge in such a way
          that makes you an efficient and competent worker. <br />
          Both EQ and IQ are also developed in different ways. EQ is developed
          through reflections and practicing self-awareness to identify emotions
          and adjust behaviour accordingly. IQ is developed by seeking and
          practicing tangible knowledge and skills such as problem solving.

      <div class="tech-para">
        <p>
          Both EQ and IQ are important to use when resolviong workplace
          conflicts. EQ allows you to understandf the other person's perspective
          and keep emoitonal responses in check, while IQ allows you to break
          down problems and apply logic to formulate solutions. Using EQ in
          tense scenarios is important, as it allows you to better manage the
          situation so that the other parties in the scenario are more receptive
          to working together towards formulating a solution to problems.
