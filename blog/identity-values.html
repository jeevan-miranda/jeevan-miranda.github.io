          In my role as a customer service rep for an accounting software
          company, I discovered an issue where the software was miscalculating
          an amount that populated in a specific financial report when
          investigating a case raised by an accountant. The issue meant that the
          report calculations were not in line with Internation Financial
          Reporting Standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          I alerted the product engagement team who advised that the product
          team couldn't prioritise a fix as they were focused on delivering new
          features.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ignoring the calculation issue would mean that our customer reports
          would not be correct, and may open them up to reporting or tax
          liabilities from regulatory agencies, so I decided to take the issue
          to a manager with previous accounting experience, and get them to
          liase directly with the Product owner to ensure the severity of the
          miscalculation is communicated and the fix received attention.

          My school instilled in me the value of following through on
          commitments and was crucial in developing my values as a person. In my
          currentl role, ownership is a value that really resonantes with me. I
          work fairly independently, and I feel taking ownership of challenges
          and mistakes always leads to positive growth.

          One of my key strengths is that Im very detail oriented, so I try to
          always put alot of attention to ensuring I don't make mistakes in my
          work. I do this by having key frameworks developed for each task, and
          testing as I go to identify and resolve problems before moving on to
          later tasks.

          My years in a customer experience roll have also helped me develop a
          unique social intelligence that helps me pick up cues from others to
          know how they are feeling and how they are motivated. This will help
          in team settings when working with my colleagues to complete tasks.

          I've always been shy to ask questions and that has been a hinderence
          in my learning and understanding. I take great lengths to try being
          self-sufficient so I don't ask many questions, but it also means for
          issues I can't easily research or find resources for, I tend to fall
          behind in the pace that I learn and develop. It's something I am
          working to address.

          I was tasked with mentoring a colleague to improve their quality of
          case management. I started the mentoring process by doing a shadowing
          session with them. During the session, I noticed they were nervous and
          appeared to be having mind blanks when investigating the issue of the
          ticket. I took a step back from the shadowing and pointed out my
          observations that they seemed to be extra nervous, which my colleague
          agreed.
        </p>
        <p>
          We then had a discussion about how they learn the best, and their past
          experiences with learning. In doing so, we identified that he
          benefited from templates and written frameworks to guide his
          investigation, so we began working on written investigation guides for
          him to follow.
