    <h1 class="h1-style">Bootcamp Learning Plan</h1>
    <h3 class="question">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
    <p class="answer">
      I think my goal has changed slightly. While I initially wanted to work in a web development role to eventually move into product owner role, I've found building code much more enjoyable, so I'm not sure now as to whether this would be my plan going forward.
      <br>
      <br>
      I'm hoping to use the skills I learn in this course to get into an engineer role where I can apply my skills to build new web products. I'd like to be able to apply myself in the role by being able ot hit the ground running and adapt to the business environment, and make sure that whatever I build, or even fix is designed with the customer and efficiency in mind.
      <br>
      <br>
      There are alot of roles this course can help me apply myself at, and I'll need to do more shadowing within my own current employer to better understand each role to find out where exactly I want to focus on moving into.
    </p>
    <h3 class="question">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
    <p class="answer">
      My biggest strength would still be my attention to detail. I'm still strong and have a methodology to how I code now, but through my pair programming I've learnt alot more about how I can improve my methodology alot more.
      <br>
      <br>
      I'm still working on my mindfulness of the big picture when it comes to building any projects. It's become alot easier when groing throught the JS carnival games, but I'm hoping to make more improvements on this.
    </p>
    <h3 class="question">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
    <p class="answer">
      While I'm a pretty good communicator in one-on-one scenarios when speaking to internal and external customers, and to colleagues, I find it hard to communicate in group scenarios. I tend to listen, at the detriment of speaking my mind. 
      <br>
      <br>
      I believe this is something I will need to work on going into the bootcamp.
    </p>
    <h3 class="question">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
    <p class="answer">
      Going over my previous point, speaking in groups and learning to work in a team scenario to achive tasks is something I'd like to work on. In most of my previous jobs I've worked independantly to achive all my tasks so never had much chance to work in a team environment.
    </p>
    <h3 class="question">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
    <p class="answer">
      I expect we'll be doing alot more javascript and also learning more about back-end coding and databases as well. In terms of core skills, I'm looking forward to working in a group and learning how to work as a team using the agile framework.
      <br>
      <br>
      In terms of what I expect from faciliators, thats a hard thing to think about as I've never done a practical course like this. I just hope they are receptive to any questions I have.
    </p>
    <h3 class="question">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h3>
    <p class="answer">
      I'm spending this revision period getting into the frame of mind to begin studying full time again. I'm trying to be mindful of how I interact with others when working in a team, and keeping an open mind to ideas put forward by faciliators and my peers so that I'm not missing any learning opportunities.
      <br>
      <br>
      In my time peer programming I learn't so much from my programming partner about their methods of approaching coding that it was a huge insight. I hope to have more experiences like that in bootcamp.
    </p>


    <h1 class="h1-style">Foundations Learning Plan</h1>
    <h3 class="question">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
    <p class="answer">
      My initial goal would be to land a job working in a web development role
      where I can work as part of a team to achive multiple projects. I'd like
      to spend 5-7 years building my development skills and working on my
      leadership and teamworking skills in an agile environment. Ideally, I hope
      that this, combined with my years working in a customer experience
      position at a large tech firm will set me up well to apply myself in a
      role as a Product owner.
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
    <p class="answer">
      I think my biggest strength is my attention to detail. I tend to be meticulous and develop a method to how I approach problems that helps me solve them efficiently.
      My biggest limitation is my ability to sometimes understand the big picture idea behind a solution when going through a task. This means that sometimes what I build may not fit the purpose exactly.
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
    <p class="answer">Currently in my work role I work very independently, based on daily KPIs. I haven't had a lot of experience working as part of a team, and I want to develop my team building and teamworking capabilities to make sure I can adapt to new team environments easier.

    <h3 class="question">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
      <ol>
        <li class="question">An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</li>
        <li class="question">What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</li>
      </ol>
    </h3>
    <p class="answer">
      <ol class="answer">
        <li>I plan to continue using the Toggl app to track my time spent on project work, and continue to reflect on whether I'm managing my time and work efficiently. Ideally, by reflecting on my time management, this will also allow me to plan ahead, and reach out to Facilitators beforehand to let them know if I need help or require more time on a sprint.<br>I want to be respectful of other learners in my group too, and I plan to be open with how I manage my time, and the commitment I put towards project work, so that I am kept accountable, and keep an open communication with my group.</li>
        <li>I've already organised part time hours with my work so that I have sufficient time to put towards each sprint. I plan to treat this similar to a work environment and remain mindful of my deadlines and the time I spend each day on sprint work.<br>
          As I go, I'm also trying to build a framework that works for me, that helps me manage my time when completing technical challenges.
          </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</h3>
    <p class="answer">I expect that faciliators will be honest with their feedback and provide me with constructive criticism of my work and any behaviours I could improve on, as this would be most beneficial to my development.</p>

    <h3 class="question">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
