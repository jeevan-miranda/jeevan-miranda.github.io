    <h3 class="question">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
    <p class="answer">
      My initial goal would be to land a job working in a web development role
      where I can work as part of a team to achive multiple projects. I'd like
      to spend 5-7 years building my development skills and working on my
      leadership and teamworking skills in an agile environment. Ideally, I hope
      that this, combined with my years working in a customer experience
      position at a large tech firm will set me up well to apply myself in a
      role as a Product owner.

    <h3 class="question">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
    <p class="answer"></p>

    <h3 class="question">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
    <p class="answer">Currently in my work role I work very independently, based on daily KPIs. I haven't had a lot of experience working as part of a team, and I want to develop my team building and teamworking capabilities to make sure I can adapt to new team environments easier.

    <h3 class="question">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
      <ol>
        <li class="question">An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</li>
        <li class="question">What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</li>
      </ol>
    </h3>
    <p class="answer">
      <ol class="answer">
        <li>I plan to continue using the Toggl app to track my time spent on project work, and continue to reflect on whether I'm managing my time and work efficiently. Ideally, by reflecting on my time management, this will also allow me to plan ahead, and reach out to Facilitators beforehand to let them know if I need help or require more time on a sprint.<br>I want to be respectful of other learners in my group too, and I plan to be open with how I manage my time, and the commitment I put towards project work, so that I am kept accountable, and keep an open communication with my group.</li>
        <li>I've already organised part time hours with my work so that I have sufficient time to put towards each sprint. I plan to treat this similar to a work environment and remain mindful of my deadlines and the time I spend each day on sprint work.<br>
          As I go, I'm also trying to build a framework that works for me, that helps me manage my time when completing technical challenges.
          </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</h3>
    <p class="answer">I expect that faciliators will be honest with their feedback and provide me with constructive criticism of my work and any behaviours I could improve on, as this would be most beneficial to my development.</p>

    <h3 class="question">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
