    </div>

      <div class="tech-para">
        <p>
          The property 'position: relative' sets the positioning of an element
          relative ot it's normal position in the flow of the webpage. Setting
          the top, bottom right or left properties will adjust the offset the
          element from it's normal position.
        </p>
        <p>
          An analogy for relative positioning would be like moving a pawn chess
          peice two pieces forward on a chess board. When moving the piece, the
          squares moved is counted relative to where the pawn is currently
          located.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="tech-div">
      <button class="tech-button">position: absolute</button>
      <div class="tech-para">
        <p>
          The property 'position: absolute' sets the element's position relative
          to the nearest ancestor (the positioned ancestor is the closes
          ancestor other than 'position: static')
        </p>
        <p>
          Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow of the
          webpage and can overlap with other elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          An analogy for fixed positioning would be moving a chess piece to a
          specific position on the chess board, eg moving the bishop to B4. The
          position is determined by the coordinates on the board regardless of
          where other pieces are located.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="tech-div">
      <button class="tech-button">position: fixed</button>
      <div class="tech-para">
        <p>
          'property: fixed' elements are positioned relative to the viewport,
          meaning that they will stay in the same place even if the page is
          scrolling. This is especially useful if you want to have an index
          displayed on a webpage that will continue to appear in the same
          position regardless of how far down a page a user scrolls.
        </p>
        <p>
          An analogy that illustrates how fixed positioning works would be like
          glueing a chess piece to a square on the chessboard. It doesn't matter
          how the other pieces move around, the glued piece is fixed in place
          regardless of how others are able to be moved.
