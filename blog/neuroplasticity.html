      <ul class="tech-para-js">There are 2 types of neuroplasticity:
        <li>Functional plasticity is the brain's ability to move functions </li>
        <li>Structural plasticity is the brain's ability to actually change its physical structure as a result of learning.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3 class="cultsubhead">What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
    <p class="tech-para-js">
      There are few techniques you can use to engage and practice neuroplasticity:
      <ul class="tech-para-js">
        <li>Stimulating your brain in new ways can have positive changes on the brain. Stimulating the brain can take the form of learning a new language, or musical instrument, or practicing art.</li>
        <li>Get plenty of rest: Sleep has been shown to have important effects on both physical and mental health. Practicing good sleep hygiene by having a consistent sleep schedule and creating an environment that contributes to good sleep can have a great impact on improving your sleep.</li>
        <li>Practicing mindfulness: by being present in the moment and reflecting on the situation, your thoughts and feelings about a situation and your behaviours, you can adapt better, and help activate the brain plasticity </li>
      </ul>

    <h3 class="cultsubhead">What is a Growth mindset?</h3>
    <p class="tech-para-js">
      Touching on it briefly before, growth mindset is the belief that our abilities can be improved through consistent effort and hardwork.
      <br>
      <br>
      Without a growth mindset, we don't put in the required effort and this leads to a lack of growth and development. Having a 'Fixed' mindset causes us to shy away from challenges and growth opportunities as we don't want to look dumb infront of others, and this can lead to a lack of experiences that would benefit our ability to learn new skills and improve ourselves.
      <br>
      <br>
      Developing a growth mindset helps us undertake a wider range of experiences that help us develop our skills.

    <h3 class="cultsubhead">Growth Mindset and my learning</h3>
    <p class="tech-para-js">
      One of the most suprising things I found in researching the topicsa of neuroplasticity and the growth mindset is the effectiveness of having this knowledge and concepts front and center in your mind. By learnign about the concepts you need to engage in, it helps keep you mindful on what changes you need to make to implement these learnings.
      <br>
      <br>
      One step in which I think is vital to developing a growth mindset in my learning journey is reflection. By reflecting on my learnings, the mistakes I make and my own feelings throughout each sprint, it will give me the opportunity to acknowledge my flaws and address them to make positive changes.
      <br>
      <br>
      In my learning, I'll also need to take more steps to be comfortable with making mistakes, and taking risks infront of my peers so I'm more comformtable with activities that lead to growth.
