            I've learn't a few things about myself.
            <br />
            <br />
            I'm quite risk averse, not just in my decisions but in my
            methodology and how I even code. I tend to spend lots of time
            researching before writing any code as opposed to trying something
            and testing. This is a hinderance in allowing me to grow and I need
            to get more comfortable with taking risks.
            <br />
            <br />
            I'm a pretty good listener. It's always been one of my principles
            that when it comes to the work environment, you have to put ego
            aside and be open to listening, as it gives you more opportunities
            to learn and grow.

            Empathy and self-awareness enable you to understand people better.
            Once you understand your co-workers and internal and external
            customers, it becomes easier to reconize their wants and needs. This
            gives us the benefit of being able to better tailor the products we
            program to suit those needs.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a programming environment is meant to be a collaborative
            environment where you work as a team, empathy and self awareness is
            also crucial in allowing us to de-escalate sensitive situations and
            resolve workplace conflicts so we can maintain that sense of
            collaboration and better serve our programming tasks.
            <br />
            <br />
            Self awareness is also crucial for growth. Without constant self
            reflection and mindfulness, it becomes harder to learn and develop
            skills.

            I was skeptical about the practicality of some of the core
            learnings, however when I went through them and researched them for
            my blogs I realised how much of what I learnt was already behaviours
            I had put into practice, but never had a phrase to describe them
            before.

            With some of the core ideas such as neuroplasticity, I find it hard
            to think in terms of practical application. It sounds like it's a
            naturally occurring phenomenon that occurs when a person implements
            certain behaviours, however to do that you need to be mindful of how
            neuroplasticity works.

            I think learning the core behavioural developments helps develops a
            more well rounded programmer, who doesn't just have the technical
            knowledge to succeed in the role, but also the soft skills to apply
            themselves in a developer role.

            I definitely don't think it's a waste of time. I've tried to be
            practical with my learnings and have tried to implement some
            behavioural changes to improve my mindfulness and slef-awareness at
            my workplace already and I feel that I've been able to improve my
            work and my relationship with my co-workers since starting this
            course.
